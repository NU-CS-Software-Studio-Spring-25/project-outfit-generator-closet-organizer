Fashion App

Task: Finding an outfit to fit a certain theme (i.e. an inputted word from user). The app would help collect clothing items from different stores and generate an outfit that fits the theme. 

MVP of Project: Client gives us a word (description) of what they want for an outfit. Our product will return (at minimum) a top and a bottom that match each other and what the client wants.
Sample: "I want an outfit for a formal get together with my co-workers (female)" - output cute shirt / skirt
