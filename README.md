Outfit Generator App

Clients who want an outfit that fit a certain theme or "vibe" can input a description into our website. The generator will then randomly generate them an outfit with a top and a bottom, with the option to reshuffle both items if they choose. Clients can also use the site as a virtual closet, and are able to input photos of their clothes onto the site and mark them under a label. These items will also be included in the randomization process if they search a matching keyword. Clients also have the option of selling their personal items on the thrift section of our site, they can set a price and put the item for sale.
